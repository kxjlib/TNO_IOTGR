 TNO_germany_narrative.1.d:0 "The Führer had made many calculations, all leading to one time. March... March would be the time that he begins his reclaimation of what is rightfully his.\n\nOnly a few short months ago, Benito Mussolini had inadvertantly kicked many things into motion which the Führer would now take advantage of without hesitation; The League of Nations, being to preoccupied with the ongoing crisis, would not be able to interfere with Germany reoccupying its own land.\n\nFurthermore France and the Communists in the East have recently signed a joint defence pact targetting Germany, which gives us ample justification to remilitarise our nation, to defend against these war-mongering powers from both sides.\n\nTime is of the essence. After Italy has conquered Ethiopia, the League of Nations would be free to intervene in our operations in the Rhine, whether this means forced demilitarisation, reoccupation of the Saar or something we cannot foresee...

 TNO_germany_narrative.2.d:0 "For almost 3 months, Heinrich had been sitting in Barracks, doing as his superiors commanded, then eating, back to work, then sleeping, and repeat. However today, that all changed. Along with his entire regiment, they were transferred from the outskirts of Breslau to Dortmund. It was quite clear what they were going to be doing there.\n\nOver a number of days they were dripfed information about their mission, until they would finally be told what they had all already knew. \"Past the Rhine, into the lands beyond!\" he was told, but on the sight of any French resistance they were to turn back and return to Barracks in Dortmund. Heinrich thought this effort futile; how stupid could the French be to allow Germany to violate the great Treaty of Versailles? After the Rhineland then what?"
